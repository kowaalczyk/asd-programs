Algorithms and data structures course at University of Warsaw, fall semester 2017-18  
Detailed overview (in Polish) of the problems available here: https://szkopul.edu.pl/c/laboratorium-z-asd-20172018/p/  
I didn't have enough time to format the code correctly and add problem descriptions everywhere, I'll try to do it before end of march.
